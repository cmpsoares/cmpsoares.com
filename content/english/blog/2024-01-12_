## Introduction

Effective collaboration in software development often hinges on clear communication channels. Especially in large organizations, the ability to promptly notify teams about mentions, assignments, or comments on GitHub is crucial. This post delves into creating centralized organizational workflows in GitHub, focusing on setting up an efficient notification system. We will use the GitHub Team Mention Notifier as our example, illustrating the process in a template setting.

## Step 1: Centralized Workflows in GitHub

Centralized workflows in GitHub allow you to manage actions across multiple repositories within an organization efficiently, providing consistency and control.

## Step 2: Implementing GitHub Team Mention Notifier

Weâ€™ll use the GitHub Team Mention Notifier as our example - a tool that notifies specified platforms when a team is mentioned or assigned in GitHub.

**Visual Representation**: A step-by-step setup process of the GitHub Team Mention Notifier, possibly using GitHub's user interface screenshots for clarity.

## Step 3: Configuring the Workflow

Set up a workflow in your repository. Here's a basic template:

```yaml
name: Team Mention Notification
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  notify_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Notify Teams
        uses: cmpsoares/gh-team-mention-notifier@v1.0.22
        with:
          config_path: 'notifications_config.json'
        env:
          WEBHOOK_URL_SECRET: ${{ secrets.WEBHOOK_URL_SECRET }}
```

### (Image Placeholder: Workflow File Example)

## Step 4: Using Organization-Level Variables

Organization-level variables can manage configurations centrally, enhancing workflow efficiency.

**Visual Representation**: A screenshot from GitHub's documentation or user interface showing how to set up and use organization-level variables.

#### Update Workflow with Organization Variable

Modify your workflow file to incorporate the organization variable `ORG_NOTIFICATION_CONFIG`:

```yaml
jobs:
  notification_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup Configuration
      run: |
        echo "$ORG_NOTIFICATION_CONFIG" > .github/workflows/notifications_config.json
      env:
        ORG_NOTIFICATION_CONFIG: ${{ vars.ORG_NOTIFICATION_CONFIG }}

    - name: Notify Teams
      uses: cmpsoares/gh-team-mention-notifier@latest
      with:
        config_path: '.github/workflows/notifications_config.json'
```

## Conclusion

Centralized workflows in GitHub, especially with tools like the GitHub Team Mention Notifier, streamline communication across multiple repositories. These workflows offer a structured approach to managing notifications and collaborations within large organizations.
